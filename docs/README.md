# Orbity Frontend — Docs

This directory contains concise documentation for the Orbity web app built with Next.js + TypeScript.  
It focuses on integration with `orbity-platform-backend`, quality gates, security, and developer experience.

## Contents

- `SECURITY.md` — security model (CSP, headers, session)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — project layout and conventions
- `ENV.md` — environment variables and examples

## Conventions
- Keep docs **short, practical, and versioned** with the code.
- Prefer **executable examples** and copy-paste snippets.
- Use **Conventional Commits** in PR titles and commit messages.
